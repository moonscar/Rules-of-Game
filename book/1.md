#Chapter 1: What Is This Book About? 
#第一章：这本书是关于什么的？

##Overview
##概述

This book is about games, all kinds of games: paper-based strategy games and first person shooters, classical board games and glitzy gambling games; math puzzles and professional sports; austere text adventures and giggly teenage party games. This book links these diverse play activities within a common framework-a framework based in game design.

这是一本关于游戏的书，所有类型的游戏：纸上策略游戏，第一人称射击游戏，经典棋盘游戏，豪华赌博游戏；数学难题，专业运动；简朴的文字冒险和**giggly青少年派对游戏**。这本书链接在一个通用框架内的各种玩耍行为————一个基于游戏设计的框架。

In The Study of Games, Brian Sutton-Smith writes, "Each person defines games in his own way-the anthropologists and folklorists in terms of historical origins; the military men, businessmen, and educators in terms of usages; the social scientists in terms of psychological and social functions. There is overwhelming evidence in all this that the meaning of games is, in part, a function of the ideas of those who think about them."[1] What, meaning, then, does the game designer bring to the study of games? What does it mean to look at games from a game design perspective?

在对游戏的研究中，Brian Sutton-Smith 写道，“每个人都用他自己的方式来定义游戏 — — 人类学家和民俗学家**着重**历史起源；军人、商人、商人，以及教育工作者**着重使用**；的社会科学家**着重**在心理和社会功能方面。 有充分的证据表明，游戏的意义在某种程度上，是那些思考游戏的人的想法中的一个一个功能。” 那么，游戏设计者对游戏的研究有什么意义呢？从游戏设计的角度看游戏意味着什么？

To answer this question, we first need to clarify what we mean by "game designer." A game designer is a particular kind of designer, much like a graphic designer, industrial designer, or architect. A game designer is not necessarily a programmer, visual designer, or project manager, although sometimes he or she can also play these roles in the creation of a game. A game designer might work alone or as part of a larger team. A game designer might create card games, social games, video games, or any other kind of game. The focus of a game designer is designing game play, conceiving and designing rules and structures that result in an experience for players.

为了回答这个问题，我们首先需要阐明一下“游戏设计师”的意思。 “一个游戏设计师是一种**特别**的设计师，就像平面设计师，工业设计师，或者建筑师。游戏设计师并不一定是程序员、视觉设计师或项目经理，尽管有时候他或她也可以在创造一个游戏的时候扮演这些角色。一个游戏设计师可能会单独行动或者作为一个更大团队的一部分。 游戏设计师可能会创造扑克游戏、社交游戏、视频游戏或其他类型的游戏。游戏设计师的关注点在于设计游戏玩法、构思和设计（游戏的）规则与结构，来为玩家带来（更好的）体验。

Thus game design, as a discipline, requires a focus on games in and of themselves. Rather than placing games in the service of another field such as sociology, literary criticism, or computer science, our aim is to study games within their own disciplinary space. Because game design is an emerging discipline, we often borrow from other areas of knowledge- from mathematics and cognitive science; from semiotics and cultural studies. We may not borrow in the most orthodox manner, but we do so in the service of helping to establish a field of game design proper.

因此，游戏设计，作为一门学科，需要专注于游戏本身和自己。我们的目标是在自己的学科领域里研究游戏，而不是为社会学、 文学批评或计算机科学等其他领域服务。因为游戏设计是一个新兴的学科，我们通常从其他领域借用一些知识（术语），从数学和认知科学领域，抑或从符号学和文化研究领域。我们并不会以非常正统的方式使用（这些知识），**我们这样做旨在建立一个游戏设计领域的范式**。

This book is about game design, not game development. It is not a "how to" book, offering tips and tricks for making successful digital games. It is not a book about digital game programming or choosing development tools; it is not about writing design documents or generating game ideas. And it is definitely not about development team dynamics or about funding, marketing, and distributing games. As a book on game design it is not a general introduction to games, a history of games, or a journalistic account of the people and circumstances that create games. There are plenty of books that cover all of these topics very well.

这是一本关于游戏设计，而不是游戏开发的书。这不是一本“如何”的书，为成功的制作数字游戏提供了小窍门和小技巧。它不是一本关于数字游戏编程或者开发工具选择的书，也不是写设计文档或者创造游戏的想法的书。这当然更不是关于开发团队动态，或者关于融资、市场营销和游戏分发的书。作为一本关于游戏设计的书，它没有对游戏和游戏历史的的总体介绍，也没有关于创造游戏的人和环境的新闻报道。有很多书已经很好地涵盖了这些话题。

Instead, Rules of Play provides something altogether different. Bridging the theoretical and practical aspects of making games, we look closely at games as designed systems, discovering patterns within their complexity that bring the challenges of game design into full view. As we explore game design as a design practice, we outline not only the concepts behind the creation of meaningful play (a core idea of this book), but also concrete methods for putting these concepts to use in your games. Written with the interests and needs of practicing designers, students, and educators in mind, our approach comes from our own experience of designing games, playing games, and teaching game design.

相反，《游戏规则》提供了完全不同的东西。（这些东西）衔接了游戏制作时方方面面的相关理论和实际工作，使我们近距离地把游戏看作设计完成的系统，在系统的复杂性中发现模式，将游戏设计的挑战带入全景。当我们把游戏设计作为一个设计实践探索时，不仅概述了有意义的游戏（本书的核心思想）的概念，而且还介绍了将这些概念应用于游戏中的具体方法。在一线设计师、学生和教育工作者的兴趣和驱动下（我们）完成了本书，我们的方法来自于自身设计游戏、 玩游戏和游戏设计教学的经验。

But the book is not just for game designers. In writing Rules of Play, we quickly realized that it has direct application to fields outside game design. The concepts and models, case studies, exercises, and bibliographies can be useful to interactive designers, architects, product designers, and other creators of interactive systems. Similarly, our focus on understanding games in and of themselves can benefit the emerging academic study of games in fields as diverse as sociology, media studies, and cultural policy. Engagement with ideas, like engagement with a game, is all about the play the ideas make possible. Even if you are not a game designer, we think you will find something here that lets you play with your own line of work in a new way.

但这本书不仅仅是写给游戏设计师的。 在本书创作中，我们很快意识到，它可以直接应用在游戏设计之外的领域。本书的概念和模型，案例研究，练习和参考书目对交互设计师、架构师、产品设计师，和其他交互系统的构建者们也有用。同样地，我们对游戏的理解，也将从各种各样新兴的学术研究中——如社会学、媒体研究和文化政策——汲取养分。**与想法的接触，就像与游戏的接触一样，都是关于创意的游戏。**即使你不是一个游戏设计师，我们认为你会在这里找到一些可以让你以新的方式进行自己工作的东西。

##Establishing a Critical Discourse
##建立一个核心的话语体系

One way to describe the project of this book is to say that we are working to establish a critical discourse for game design. We agree with veteran game designer Warren Spector that "It is absolutely vital that we start to build a vocabulary that allows us to examine, with some degree of precision, how games evoke emotional-intellectual responses in players".[2] As a nascent field of inquiry, there are not yet well-developed ways of talking about games and how they function.

一种描述本书工作的方法是，我们正在努力建立一个核心的游戏设计话语。我们同意资深游戏设计师沃伦·斯佩克特的观点：“开始建立一个词表至关重要，让我们能够以一定的精确度来检验游戏如何激发玩家的情绪反应。”作为一个新兴的探究领域，关于游戏及其功能的讨论还没有成熟的方式。

What is the point of establishing a critical discourse? Simply put, a critical vocabulary lets us talk to each other. It lets us share ideas and knowledge, and in doing so, expands the borders of our emerging field. Media theorist and game scholar Henry Jenkins identifies four ways that building a critical discourse around games can assist not just game designers, but the field as a whole:

建立一个核心话语体系有什么意义？简单来说，一个关键的词表能让我们互相交流。它可以让我们分享想法和知识，在这样做，扩大我们新兴领域的边界。媒体理论家和游戏学者 Henry Jenkins 认为，围绕游戏建立核心话语体系的的四种方式，不仅可以帮助游戏设计师，对于全局（的考虑）也有裨益：

* Training: A common language facilitates the education of game designers, letting them explore their medium in more variety and depth.
* 训练：一种共同的语言促进了游戏设计师的教育，让他们可以更多样化和深入地探索他们的媒介。
* Generational Transfer: Within the field, a disciplinary vocabulary lets game designers and developers pass on skills and knowledge, rather than solving the same problems over and over in isolation.
* 代际传递：在这个领域内，一个学科词表可以让游戏设计者和开发人员交流技能和知识，而不是孤立地解决同样的问题。
* Audience-building: In finding a way to speak about them, games can be reviewed, critiqued, and advertised to the public in more sophisticated ways.
* 构建观众侧写：在寻找方法谈论它们的时候，游戏可以被评论，批评，并以更复杂的方式向公众宣传。
* Buffer Against Criticism: There are many factions that would seek to censor and regulate the content and contexts for gaming, particularly computer and video games. A critical discourse gives us the vocabulary and understanding to defend against these attacks.[3]
* 对批评的缓冲：有许多派系会试图审查和监管游戏的内容和游戏的环境，尤其是电脑和视频游戏。一个核心话语体系为我们提供了词汇和理解，来抵御这些攻击。

Creating a critical discourse requires that we look at games and the game design process from the ground up, proposing methods for the analysis of games, assessing what makes a great game great, and asking questions about what games are and how they function. The result is a deeper understanding of game design that can lead to genuine innovation in the practice of making games.

创造一个关键的话语需要我们自底向上来观察游戏本身和游戏设计过程，提出分析游戏的方法，来评估什么是伟大的游戏；询问游戏是什么以及它们是如何运作的。其结果是，对游戏设计的更深层次的理解，可以在游戏的实践中产生真正的创新。

Part of creating a critical discourse is defining concepts, but arriving at such a vocabulary is no simple task, for it involves creating definitions for words that often thread their way through multiple and contradictory contexts. One challenge of our project has been formulating a set of definitions for terms such as "game," "design," "interactivity," "system," "play," and "culture," terms that form the foundation of our critical vocabulary. As we explore the largely uncharted terrain of game design, definitions stake out boundaries, the way a set of points define a plane in space.

定义概念是创造核心话语体系的一部分工作，但是构建这样一个词汇表并不简单，因为它涉及到为单词创建定义，这些词汇通常会在多个相互矛盾的上下文中出现。我们项目的一个挑战就是为“游戏”、“设计”、“设计”、“互动”、“互动”和“文化”等构成我们核心词表的词条制定一系列的定义。当我们探索游戏设计的未知领域时，定义树立了界限，就像一组点在空间中定义一个平面一样。

Practically speaking, defining terms is useful. But an overemphasis on definitions can be dangerous. Held in too orthodox a manner, definitions become a way of shutting down communication and insight. For us, a definition is not a closed or scientific representation of "reality." For a designer, the value of a definition is its ability to serve as a critical tool for understanding and solving design problems. In other words, by including definitions, our intention is not to exclude other definitions that might complement or contradict our own. We wholeheartedly acknowledge that our definitions, concepts, and models leave some things out and work better in some circumstances than others. But this doesn't lessen their overall utility.
It is often along the seams and cracks formed when competing definitions bump up against one another that new ideas are born. Our hope for game design is that it becomes a field as rich as any other, filled with vibrant discussion and dialogue as well as virulent debate and disagreement.

实际上，定义术语是有用的。但是，过分强调定义的重要性可能是危险的。如果以过于古板的方式来约束它，定义就会阻碍沟通和洞察。对我们来说，一个定义不是“现实”的一个接近的或科学的表示方式。对于一个设计师来说，定义的价值就在于它能够作为理解和解决设计问题的关键工具。换句话说，当我们使用定义时，并不意味着我们将排除其他可能的补充定义、矛盾定义。我们全心全意地承认，我们的定义、概念和模型在可以帮助我们排除杂念，并在某些情况下更好地工作。但这并不能减少他们的总体效用。当相互竞争的定义相互碰撞，往往会出现裂缝和裂缝，新的想法就会从这里诞生。我们对游戏设计的希望就是它可以成为一个像领域一样丰富的领域，充满了活力的讨论对话，也不缺乏辛辣的辩论与分歧。


##Ways of Looking
##看待的方式
A game is a particular way of looking at something, anything. -Clark C. Abt,Serious Games
游戏是一种看待事物的视角，任何事物。-Clark C. Abt,《严肃游戏》

---

Social theorist Clark C. Abt makes a powerful suggestion. In his claim that a game is a particular way of looking at something, at anything, we find inspiration for our own approach to game design. How can we use games as a way to understand aesthetics, communication, culture, and other areas of our world that seem so intertwined with games? Conversely, how can we use our understanding of these areas to enrich our practice of designing games? Too often, analyses and readings of games simply do not do justice to their complexity. Game designer and theorist Jesper Juul has made the comment that theories about games tend to fall into two camps: Everything is a game ("War is a game; politics are a game; life is a game; everything is a game!") or Games are X ("Games are an interactive storytelling medium.";"Games are how a child learns about rules.").[4]
If games are not everything, nor just one thing, what are they? Perhaps they are many things. It would be strange for us to say, for example, that poetry is storytelling. Although storytelling is one way of understanding poetry, it is just one of many possible perspectives. We could also explore poetry formally, within the context of rhyme and meter, or historically, with an emphasis on printing technologies. Each of these perspectives offers a valid way of looking at poetry-yet utilizing just one of them gives access to only part of the total picture. On the other hand, these frames, and many others, considered together begin to sketch out the heterogeneous and multifaceted cultural phenomena called poetry. In Rules of Play, this is exactly what we do with games. Our general strategy is to provide multiple points of view for understanding. In doing so, we hope to avoid the common pitfalls Juul mentions while being true to the complex and polymorphous nature of games.
Is this approach appropriate for design? Absolutely. In his book Notes on the Synthesis of Form, architect Christopher Alexander wrestles with the challenges of design, describing a methodology that centers on the inherent complexity of design problems. His argument is based in part on the assumption that clarity in form cannot be achieved until there is first clarity in the designer's mind and actions. Alexander asks us to consider the range of factors affecting the design of a kettle.
Let us look again at just what kind of difficulty the designer faces. Take, for example, the design of a simple kettle. He has to invent a kettle, which fits the context of its use. It must not be too small. It must not be hard to pick up when it is hot. It must not be easy to let go of by mistake. It must not be hard to store in the kitchen. It must not be hard to get the water out of. It must pour cleanly. It must not let the water in it cool too quickly. The material it is made out of must not cost too much. It must be able to withstand the temperature of boiling water. It must not be too hard to clean on the outside. It must not be a shape which is too hard to machine. It must not be a shape which is unsuitable for whatever reasonably priced metal it is made of. It must not be too hard to assemble, since this costs man-hours of labor. It must not corrode in steamy kitchens. Its inside must not be too difficult to keep free of scale. It must not be hard to fill with water. It must not be uneconomical to heat small quantities of water in, when it is not full. It must not appeal to such a minority that it cannot be manufactured in an appropriate way because of its small demand. It must not be so tricky to hold that accidents occur when children or invalids try to use it. It must not be able to boil dry and burn out without warning. It must not be unstable on the stove while it is boiling.[5]
Alexander's answer to the challenge of complexity is to organize and classify aspects of the design problem at hand. The patterns that arise as a result of this analysis allow the designer to, as Alexander puts it,"overcome the difficulties of complexity." As the designer systematizes elements of the problem, he or she gives it shape, casting the problem in a whole new light.
Games too, share in this degree of complexity. As products of human culture, games fulfill a range of needs, desires, pleasures, and uses. As products of design culture, games reflect a host of technological, material, formal, and economic concerns. It would be ineffective (and even silly) to try and view such a complex phenomenon from a single perspective. To do so would be to miss most of the design problem entirely. Our solution? Game design schemas.

Game Design Schemas
Most of the chapters of this book are organized under the heading of a game design schema. A schema is a way of framing and organizing knowledge. A game design schema is a way of understanding games, a conceptual lens that we can apply to the analysis or creation of a game. What are some of the game design schemas we employ in the course of this book? We look at games through the mathematical lens of probability. We look at them as contexts for social interaction. We look at games as storytelling systems. We look at them as sites of cultural resistance. We do so in every case from the point of view of game design.
We organize these varied points of view according to three primary schemas, each one containing a cluster of related schemas. Our primary schemas are RULES, PLAY, and CULTURE:
* RULES contains formal game design schemas that focus on the essential logical and mathematical structures of a game.
* PLAY contains experiential, social, and representational game design schemas that foreground the player's participation with the game and with other players.
* CULTURE contains contextual game design schemas that investigate the larger cultural contexts within which games are designed and played.
These schemas not only organize ways of looking at games but also, when taken as a whole, offer a general method for the study of game design. Each schema brings certain aspects of games to light, while building on previous schemas to arrive at a multivalent understanding of games. The three primary schemas are neither mutually exclusive nor scientific in nature. We have not created them as a taxonomy, in order to say "this is a feature of RULES, not a feature of PLAY."Rather, they are conceptual design tools to help focus our thinking for particular design problems.
As a framework, RULES, PLAY, CULTURE is not merely a model for game design. It also represents a way of understanding any kind of design. Consider the model applied more broadly:

* RULES = the organization of the designed system
* PLAY = the human experience of that system
* CULTURE = the larger contexts engaged with and inhabited by the system

In analyzing or creating a typeface, for example, you might study the formal rules of the system (how the visual weights of the letterforms relate to each other), the play of the system (the kind of reading experience that the typeface engenders), or the cultural aspects of the system (historical references and the contexts where the typeface will be seen). RULES, PLAY, and CULTURE is a structure that can facilitate critical design thinking in any design field.

## Game Design Fundamentals
## 游戏设计基础
Rules of Play is a book about fundamentals. As a design practice, game design has its own essential principles, a system of ideas that define what games are and how they work. Innovation in the field can grow only from a deep understanding of these basic concepts. What are these game design fundamentals? They include understanding design, systems, and interactivity, as well as player choice, action, and outcome. They include a study of rule-making and rule-breaking, complexity and emergence, game experience, game representation, and social game interaction. They include the powerful connection between the rules of a game and the play that the rules engender, the pleasures games invoke, the meanings they construct, the ideologies they embody, and the stories they tell.
As fundamental principles, these ideas form a system of building blocks that game designers arrange and rearrange in every game they create. As unlikely as it may sound, Go, Trivial Pursuit, Dance Dance Revolution, and Unreal Tournament all share the same fundamental principles, articulated in radically different ways. The range of game design expression is vast, deep, and largely unexplored. By clarifying these ideas, we can provide a set of strategies that help you fit these fundamentals to your particular design needs.
Rules of Play is a book for practicing game scholars and designers, but it is also very much about teaching and learning. Game design education represents an important counterpoint to game design theory and practice, for in the classroom the fundamentals established in this book can be explored, dissected, critiqued, and reinvented. In developing material for teaching and learning, we had to ask, What are the principle elements that constitute a game design curriculum? What courses does the curriculum include, what are the objectives of the courses, what is it that students need to know to become game designers?
These are questions certain to be raised by colleges, universities, and other professional institutions as they develop educational programs in game design. The needs of these programs are diverse: there is a tremendous difference between a graduate game design degree program in a school of fine arts, an undergraduate minor in game design within a comparative media department, and an industry workshop on game design at a professional conference.

No single curriculum can fit all of these contexts. Rather than design a single program, we have instead provided tools to allow faculty to address their own particular circumstances. We developed the bibliography, suggested readings, case studies, commissioned games, and game design exercises with this kind of flexibility in mind. We believe that a variety of curricula that meet the needs of different (and perhaps competing) perspectives will lead to better games, better game designers, and hours and hours of more meaningful play.

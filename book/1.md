#第一章：这本书是关于什么的？

##Overview
##概述

This book is about games, all kinds of games: paper-based strategy games and first person shooters, classical board games and glitzy gambling games; math puzzles and professional sports; austere text adventures and giggly teenage party games. This book links these diverse play activities within a common framework-a framework based in game design.

这是一本关于游戏的书，所有类型的游戏：纸上策略游戏，第一人称射击游戏，经典棋盘游戏，豪华赌博游戏；数学难题，专业运动；简朴的文字冒险和**giggly青少年派对游戏**。这本书链接在一个通用框架内的各种玩耍行为————一个基于游戏设计的框架。

In The Study of Games, Brian Sutton-Smith writes, "Each person defines games in his own way-the anthropologists and folklorists in terms of historical origins; the military men, businessmen, and educators in terms of usages; the social scientists in terms of psychological and social functions. There is overwhelming evidence in all this that the meaning of games is, in part, a function of the ideas of those who think about them."[1] What, meaning, then, does the game designer bring to the study of games? What does it mean to look at games from a game design perspective?

在对游戏的研究中，Brian Sutton-Smith 写道，“每个人都用他自己的方式来定义游戏 — — 人类学家和民俗学家**着重**历史起源；军人、商人、商人，以及教育工作者**着重使用**；的社会科学家**着重**在心理和社会功能方面。 有充分的证据表明，游戏的意义在某种程度上，是那些思考游戏的人的想法中的一个一个功能。” 那么，游戏设计者对游戏的研究有什么意义呢？从游戏设计的角度看游戏意味着什么？

To answer this question, we first need to clarify what we mean by "game designer." A game designer is a particular kind of designer, much like a graphic designer, industrial designer, or architect. A game designer is not necessarily a programmer, visual designer, or project manager, although sometimes he or she can also play these roles in the creation of a game. A game designer might work alone or as part of a larger team. A game designer might create card games, social games, video games, or any other kind of game. The focus of a game designer is designing game play, conceiving and designing rules and structures that result in an experience for players.

为了回答这个问题，我们首先需要澄清一下“ 游戏设计师” 的意思。 “ 一个游戏设计师是一种特别的设计师，就像一个平面设计师，工业设计师，或者建筑师。 游戏设计师并不一定是程序员、 视觉设计师或项目经理， 尽管有时候他或她也可以在创造一个游戏的时候扮演这些角色。 一个游戏设计师可能会单独行动或者作为一个更大团队的一部分。 游戏设计师可能会创造扑克游戏、 社交游戏、 视频游戏或其他类型的游戏。 游戏设计师的焦点在于设计游戏游戏、 怀孕、 设计规则和结构，以此为玩家带来经验。
Thus game design, as a discipline, requires a focus on games in and of themselves. Rather than placing games in the service of another field such as sociology, literary criticism, or computer science, our aim is to study games within their own disciplinary space. Because game design is an emerging discipline, we often borrow from other areas of knowledge- from mathematics and cognitive science; from semiotics and cultural studies. We may not borrow in the most orthodox manner, but we do so in the service of helping to establish a field of game design proper.

因此，游戏设计，作为一项纪律，需要专注于游戏自身和自己。 而不是在社会学、 文学批评或计算机科学等其他领域进行游戏。 我们的目标是在自己的纪律空间里学习游戏。 因为游戏设计是一个新兴的纪律，我们通常从数学和认知科学的知识领域借用。 来自符号学和文化研究。 我们不能以最正统的方式借贷, 但是我们在帮助建立一个游戏设计领域的服务中也是如此。
This book is about game design, not game development. It is not a "how to" book, offering tips and tricks for making successful digital games. It is not a book about digital game programming or choosing development tools; it is not about writing design documents or generating game ideas. And it is definitely not about development team dynamics or about funding, marketing, and distributing games. As a book on game design it is not a general introduction to games, a history of games, or a journalistic account of the people and circumstances that create games. There are plenty of books that cover all of these topics very well.

这本书是关于游戏设计，而不是游戏开发。 这不是一本“ 如何” 的书，为成功的数字游戏提供了技巧和技巧。 它不是一本关于数字游戏编程或者选择开发工具的书，它不是写设计文档或者创造游戏的想法。 这绝对不是关于发展团队的动力学，也不是关于融资、 市场营销和分销游戏。 作为一本关于游戏设计的书，它不是一场游戏的普遍介绍，游戏的历史， 或者是一个新闻记者关于人民和情况的记录。 有很多书都很好地涵盖了这些话题。
Instead, Rules of Play provides something altogether different. Bridging the theoretical and practical aspects of making games, we look closely at games as designed systems, discovering patterns within their complexity that bring the challenges of game design into full view. As we explore game design as a design practice, we outline not only the concepts behind the creation of meaningful play (a core idea of this book), but also concrete methods for putting these concepts to use in your games. Written with the interests and needs of practicing designers, students, and educators in mind, our approach comes from our own experience of designing games, playing games, and teaching game design.

相反，游戏规则提供了完全不同的东西。 与游戏的理论和实际方面衔接，我们仔细地看待游戏作为设计的系统， 在他们的复杂性中发现的模式，将游戏设计的挑战带入全景。 当我们探索游戏设计作为一个设计实践时，我们概述了创作有意义的剧本背后的概念 （ 这本书的核心思想 ） ， 但是也有具体的方法把这些概念用在你的游戏中。 书写的利益和需要的设计师、 学生和教育工作者 我们的方法来自于我们自己设计游戏、 玩游戏和教学设计的经验。
But the book is not just for game designers. In writing Rules of Play, we quickly realized that it has direct application to fields outside game design. The concepts and models, case studies, exercises, and bibliographies can be useful to interactive designers, architects, product designers, and other creators of interactive systems. Similarly, our focus on understanding games in and of themselves can benefit the emerging academic study of games in fields as diverse as sociology, media studies, and cultural policy. Engagement with ideas, like engagement with a game, is all about the play the ideas make possible. Even if you are not a game designer, we think you will find something here that lets you play with your own line of work in a new way.

但这本书不仅仅是游戏设计师的一部分。 在书写规则中，我们很快意识到，它有直接的应用程序在游戏设计之外的领域。 这些概念和模型，案例研究，运动和运动可以对互动设计师、 建筑师、 产品设计师们有用。 以及互动系统的创造者。 同样地, 我们对理解游戏的关注，可以从新兴的学术研究中获益于社会学这样多样化的学术研究。 媒体研究和文化政策。 与思想订婚，比如参与一个游戏，就是所有的想法是可能的。 即使你不是一个游戏设计师，我们认为你会在这里找到一些可以让你以新的方式玩自己的工作的东西。

##Establishing a Critical Discourse
##建立一个关键的话语

One way to describe the project of this book is to say that we are working to establish a critical discourse for game design. We agree with veteran game designer Warren Spector that "It is absolutely vital that we start to build a vocabulary that allows us to examine, with some degree of precision, how games evoke emotional-intellectual responses in players".[2] As a nascent field of inquiry, there are not yet well-developed ways of talking about games and how they function.
What is the point of establishing a critical discourse? Simply put, a critical vocabulary lets us talk to each other. It lets us share ideas and knowledge, and in doing so, expands the borders of our emerging field. Media theorist and game scholar Henry Jenkins identifies four ways that building a critical discourse around games can assist not just game designers, but the field as a whole:
• Training: A common language facilitates the education of game designers, letting them explore their medium in more variety and depth.
• Generational Transfer: Within the field, a disciplinary vocabulary lets game designers and developers pass on skills and knowledge, rather than solving the same problems over and over in isolation.
• Audience-building: In finding a way to speak about them, games can be reviewed, critiqued, and advertised to the public in more sophisticated ways.
• Buffer Against Criticism: There are many factions that would seek to censor and regu late the content and contexts for gaming, particularly computer and video games. A critical discourse gives us the vocabulary and understanding to defend against these attacks.[3]
Creating a critical discourse requires that we look at games and the game design process from the ground up, proposing methods for the analysis of games, assessing what makes a great game great, and asking questions about what games are and how they function. The result is a deeper understanding of game design that can lead to genuine innovation in the practice of making games.
Part of creating a critical discourse is defining concepts, but arriving at such a vocabulary is no simple task, for it involves creating definitions for words that often thread their way through multiple and contradictory contexts. One challenge of our project has been formulating a set of definitions for terms such as "game," "design," "interactivity," "system," "play," and "culture," terms that form the foundation of our critical vocabulary. As we explore the largely uncharted terrain of game design, definitions stake out boundaries, the way a set of points define a plane in space.
Practically speaking, defining terms is useful. But an overemphasis on definitions can be dangerous. Held in too orthodox a manner, definitions become a way of shutting down communication and insight. For us, a definition is not a closed or scientific representation of "reality." For a designer, the value of a definition is its ability to serve as a critical tool for understanding and solving design problems. In other words, by including definitions, our intention is not to exclude other definitions that might complement or contradict our own. We wholeheartedly acknowledge that our definitions, concepts, and models leave some things out and work better in some circumstances than others. But this doesn't lessen their overall utility.
It is often along the seams and cracks formed when competing definitions bump up against one another that new ideas are born. Our hope for game design is that it becomes a field as rich as any other, filled with vibrant discussion and dialogue as well as virulent debate and disagreement.

##Ways of Looking
##看待的方式
A game is a particular way of looking at something, anything. -Clark C. Abt, Serious Games
Social theorist Clark C. Abt makes a powerful suggestion. In his claim that a game is a particular way of looking at something, at anything, we find inspiration for our own approach to game design. How can we use games as a way to understand aesthetics, communication, culture, and other areas of our world that seem so intertwined with games? Conversely, how can we use our understanding of these areas to enrich our practice of designing games? Too often, analyses and readings of games simply do not do justice to their complexity. Game designer and theorist Jesper Juul has made the comment that theories about games tend to fall into two camps: Everything is a game ("War is a game; politics are a game; life is a game; everything is a game!") or Games are X ("Games are an interactive storytelling medium.";"Games are how a child learns about rules.").[4]
If games are not everything, nor just one thing, what are they? Perhaps they are many things. It would be strange for us to say, for example, that poetry is storytelling. Although storytelling is one way of understanding poetry, it is just one of many possible perspectives. We could also explore poetry formally, within the context of rhyme and meter, or historically, with an emphasis on printing technologies. Each of these perspectives offers a valid way of looking at poetry-yet utilizing just one of them gives access to only part of the total picture. On the other hand, these frames, and many others, considered together begin to sketch out the heterogeneous and multifaceted cultural phenomena called poetry. In Rules of Play, this is exactly what we do with games. Our general strategy is to provide multiple points of view for understanding. In doing so, we hope to avoid the common pitfalls Juul mentions while being true to the complex and polymorphous nature of games.
Is this approach appropriate for design? Absolutely. In his book Notes on the Synthesis of Form, architect Christopher Alexander wrestles with the challenges of design, describing a methodology that centers on the inherent complexity of design problems. His argument is based in part on the assumption that clarity in form cannot be achieved until there is first clarity in the designer's mind and actions. Alexander asks us to consider the range of factors affecting the design of a kettle.
Let us look again at just what kind of difficulty the designer faces. Take, for example, the design of a simple kettle. He has to invent a kettle, which fits the context of its use. It must not be too small. It must not be hard to pick up when it is hot. It must not be easy to let go of by mistake. It must not be hard to store in the kitchen. It must not be hard to get the water out of. It must pour cleanly. It must not let the water in it cool too quickly. The material it is made out of must not cost too much. It must be able to withstand the temperature of boiling water. It must not be too hard to clean on the outside. It must not be a shape which is too hard to machine. It must not be a shape which is unsuitable for whatever reasonably priced metal it is made of. It must not be too hard to assemble, since this costs man-hours of labor. It must not corrode in steamy kitchens. Its inside must not be too difficult to keep free of scale. It must not be hard to fill with water. It must not be uneconomical to heat small quantities of water in, when it is not full. It must not appeal to such a minority that it cannot be manufactured in an appropriate way because of its small demand. It must not be so tricky to hold that accidents occur when children or invalids try to use it. It must not be able to boil dry and burn out without warning. It must not be unstable on the stove while it is boiling.[5]
Alexander's answer to the challenge of complexity is to organize and classify aspects of the design problem at hand. The patterns that arise as a result of this analysis allow the designer to, as Alexander puts it,"overcome the difficulties of complexity." As the designer systematizes elements of the problem, he or she gives it shape, casting the problem in a whole new light.
Games too, share in this degree of complexity. As products of human culture, games fulfill a range of needs, desires, pleasures, and uses. As products of design culture, games reflect a host of technological, material, formal, and economic concerns. It would be ineffective (and even silly) to try and view such a complex phenomenon from a single perspective. To do so would be to miss most of the design problem entirely. Our solution? Game design schemas.

Game Design Schemas
Most of the chapters of this book are organized under the heading of a game design schema. A schema is a way of framing and organizing knowledge. A game design schema is a way of understanding games, a conceptual lens that we can apply to the analysis or creation of a game. What are some of the game design schemas we employ in the course of this book? We look at games through the mathematical lens of probability. We look at them as contexts for social interaction. We look at games as storytelling systems. We look at them as sites of cultural resistance. We do so in every case from the point of view of game design.
We organize these varied points of view according to three primary schemas, each one containing a cluster of related schemas. Our primary schemas are RULES, PLAY, and CULTURE:
* RULES contains formal game design schemas that focus on the essential logical and mathematical structures of a game.
* PLAY contains experiential, social, and representational game design schemas that foreground the player's participation with the game and with other players.
* CULTURE contains contextual game design schemas that investigate the larger cultural contexts within which games are designed and played.
These schemas not only organize ways of looking at games but also, when taken as a whole, offer a general method for the study of game design. Each schema brings certain aspects of games to light, while building on previous schemas to arrive at a multivalent understanding of games. The three primary schemas are neither mutually exclusive nor scientific in nature. We have not created them as a taxonomy, in order to say "this is a feature of RULES, not a feature of PLAY."Rather, they are conceptual design tools to help focus our thinking for particular design problems.
As a framework, RULES, PLAY, CULTURE is not merely a model for game design. It also represents a way of understanding any kind of design. Consider the model applied more broadly:

* RULES = the organization of the designed system
* PLAY = the human experience of that system
* CULTURE = the larger contexts engaged with and inhabited by the system

In analyzing or creating a typeface, for example, you might study the formal rules of the system (how the visual weights of the letterforms relate to each other), the play of the system (the kind of reading experience that the typeface engenders), or the cultural aspects of the system (historical references and the contexts where the typeface will be seen). RULES, PLAY, and CULTURE is a structure that can facilitate critical design thinking in any design field.

## Game Design Fundamentals
## 游戏设计基础
Rules of Play is a book about fundamentals. As a design practice, game design has its own essential principles, a system of ideas that define what games are and how they work. Innovation in the field can grow only from a deep understanding of these basic concepts. What are these game design fundamentals? They include understanding design, systems, and interactivity, as well as player choice, action, and outcome. They include a study of rule-making and rule-breaking, complexity and emergence, game experience, game representation, and social game interaction. They include the powerful connection between the rules of a game and the play that the rules engender, the pleasures games invoke, the meanings they construct, the ideologies they embody, and the stories they tell.
As fundamental principles, these ideas form a system of building blocks that game designers arrange and rearrange in every game they create. As unlikely as it may sound, Go, Trivial Pursuit, Dance Dance Revolution, and Unreal Tournament all share the same fundamental principles, articulated in radically different ways. The range of game design expression is vast, deep, and largely unexplored. By clarifying these ideas, we can provide a set of strategies that help you fit these fundamentals to your particular design needs.
Rules of Play is a book for practicing game scholars and designers, but it is also very much about teaching and learning. Game design education represents an important counterpoint to game design theory and practice, for in the classroom the fundamentals established in this book can be explored, dissected, critiqued, and reinvented. In developing material for teaching and learning, we had to ask, What are the principle elements that constitute a game design curriculum? What courses does the curriculum include, what are the objectives of the courses, what is it that students need to know to become game designers?
These are questions certain to be raised by colleges, universities, and other professional institutions as they develop educational programs in game design. The needs of these programs are diverse: there is a tremendous difference between a graduate game design degree program in a school of fine arts, an undergraduate minor in game design within a comparative media department, and an industry workshop on game design at a professional conference.

No single curriculum can fit all of these contexts. Rather than design a single program, we have instead provided tools to allow faculty to address their own particular circumstances. We developed the bibliography, suggested readings, case studies, commissioned games, and game design exercises with this kind of flexibility in mind. We believe that a variety of curricula that meet the needs of different (and perhaps competing) perspectives will lead to better games, better game designers, and hours and hours of more meaningful play.
